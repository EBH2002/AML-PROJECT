# BDD100k Instance Segmentation with Mask R-CNN

This is a final project for **Applied Machine Learning** Course at Chennai Mathematical Institute. Instance Segmentation with Berkeley DeepDrive dataset using [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet50 backbone.
